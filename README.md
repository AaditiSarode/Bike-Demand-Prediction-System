# Bike-Demand-Prediction-System

Smart Bike Demand Prediction System
A Machine Learning based interactive GUI application that predicts hourly bike rental demand using historical data and environmental conditions.

Project Overview
Urban bike-sharing systems require accurate demand forecasting to ensure optimal bike availability.
This project uses Machine Learning (Random Forest Regression) to predict the number of rental bikes required at a given hour based on:

-Time (Hour)
-Temperature
-Humidity
-Wind Speed
-Working Day
-Holiday
-Weather Conditions
